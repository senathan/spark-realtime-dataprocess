Jira Story: Wireframe & Planning for Cloud-WAF Onboarding
Title:
Wireframe Creation, Story Breakdown, and API HLD Planning for Cloud-WAF Onboarding

Label:
Cloud-WAF-Onboarding-Planning

Description:
As a lead developer, I want to create UI wireframes, break down features into stories, collaborate with the team for estimation, and define API-level integration for Cloud-WAF onboarding so that the implementation phase is smooth and technically aligned.

Acceptance Criteria:
Wireframes must be reviewed and approved by stakeholders.

Each major module (Database, Batch, UI) should have a breakdown of stories with sizes (T-shirt or estimation points).

A detailed HLD must be prepared and uploaded to Confluence (or shared platform).

API dependencies must be identified with endpoint, method, and payload structure.

Jira should be updated with story IDs, links, and cross-dependencies where applicable.

Sub-Tasks:
Create initial wireframes for onboarding UI

Use Figma or Draw.io

Cover onboarding form, host info, service info, error pages

Include step-by-step modal design

Story sizing workshop with team

Schedule a 30–60 min session

Present wireframes and feature ideas

Document estimates in a central sheet

API research and endpoint mapping

Document all required Akamai API endpoints

Capture headers, URL params, request/response formats

High-level design (HLD) preparation

Define architecture components (DB, batch jobs, UI)

Mention data flow, async/sync processing

Include diagrams and state handling details

Create or link detailed Jira stories from epic

Break feature into logical modules

Assign label: Cloud-WAF-Onboarding

Add epic link and dependencies

Review with peers and leads

Setup a walkthrough session

Collect feedback and revise wireframes / HLD as needed

Update documentation and story summary

Ensure all stories have up-to-date descriptions

Link all relevant diagrams, APIs, and shared documents

Let me know if you want this in Excel or Jira import format, or if you'd like similar breakdowns for other epics or stories.
